# Vulnerability Management Program Implementation

In this project, we simulate the implementation of a comprehensive vulnerability management program, from inception to completion.

_**Inception State:**_ the organization has no existing policy or vulnerability management practices in place.

_**Completion State:**_ a formal policy is enacted, stakeholder buy-in is secured, and a full cycle of organization-wide vulnerability remediation is successfully completed.

### Vulnerability Management Policy Draft Creation

This phase focuses on drafting a Vulnerability Management Policy as a starting point for stakeholder engagement. The initial draft outlines scope, responsibilities, and remediation timelines, and may be adjusted based on feedback from relevant departments to ensure practical implementation before final approval by upper management.  
[Draft Policy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tx2xxKo-FgmGyjub9MSgKi6hk2ujimTsSfu4dRnroBc/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.wzer8el0objm)

### Step 2) Mock Meeting: Policy Buy-In (Stakeholders)

This phase simulates a stakeholder meeting designed to secure buy-in from the server team for the proposed Vulnerability Management Policy. The purpose is twofold:

Introduce the draft policy — outlining its scope, responsibilities, and remediation timelines for vulnerabilities of varying severity.
Assess operational feasibility — ensuring the remediation expectations are realistic and achievable given the team’s resources, testing procedures, and business continuity needs.
The meeting begins with the Security Lead presenting the policy, emphasizing its role in reducing risk exposure for critical systems and safeguarding sensitive client data. The server team is invited to share practical concerns, especially regarding the short turnaround time for critical vulnerability remediation.
Through discussion, it becomes clear that the original 48-hour remediation window for critical vulnerabilities may be impractical due to testing, change management processes, and the potential impact on production environments. The team collectively agrees to extend the window to one week, with an emergency override clause for high-risk situations requiring immediate patching.

By the end of this phase:

The policy draft is adjusted collaboratively to balance security requirements with operational realities.
Stakeholders feel heard and invested, improving the likelihood of policy adoption.
Next steps include revising the document to reflect changes and preparing it for upper management review.

### Step 3) Policy Finalization and Senior Leadership Sign-Off

After collecting feedback from the server team, adjustments were made to ensure the policy was realistic and achievable in daily operations. In particular, remediation timelines were revised to balance security urgency with operational feasibility.
Following revisions, the policy was submitted to senior leadership for final review and approval. Once signed off, it became the official guiding document for the organization’s vulnerability management program.

Key Outcomes:

Incorporated cross-team feedback to improve practical implementation.
Adjusted aggressive remediation timelines to align with resource constraints while maintaining compliance.
Obtained executive approval, giving the policy authority for enforcement and reference in pushback scenarios.

### Step 4) Mock Meeting: Initial Scan Permission (Server Team)

The team collaborates with the server team to initiate scheduled credential scans. A compromise is reached to scan a single server first, monitoring resource impact, and using just-in-time Active Directory credentials for secure, controlled access.

### Step 5) Initial Scan of Server Team Assets

In this phase, a deliberately vulnerable Windows Server instance is provisioned to represent the server team’s environment. The system is intentionally misconfigured and outdated to introduce common security weaknesses, including missing patches, insecure services, and legacy protocols. Once the environment is prepared, an authenticated vulnerability scan is conducted using temporary credentials to replicate real-world conditions and ensure accurate detection. The scan results are then exported in a sanitized report, which serves as the foundation for prioritizing risks, documenting remediation efforts, and tracking improvements in subsequent phases of the project.

### Step 6) Vulnerability Assessment and Prioritization

We assessed vulnerabilities and established a remediation prioritization strategy based on ease of remediation and impact. The following priorities were set:

1. Third Party Software Removal (Wireshark)
2. Windows OS Secure Configuration (Protocols & Ciphers)
3. Windows OS Secure Configuration (Guest Account Group Membership)
4. Windows OS Updates

---

### Step 7) Distributing Remediations to Remediation Teams

The server team received remediation scripts and scan reports to address key vulnerabilities. This streamlined their efforts and prepared them for a follow-up review.

### Step 8) Mock Meeting: Post-Initial Discovery Scan (Server Team)

The server team reviewed vulnerability scan results, identifying outdated software, insecure accounts, and deprecated protocols. The remediation packages were prepared for submission to the Change Control Board (CAB).

### Step 9) Mock CAB Meeting: Implementing Remediations

The Change Control Board (CAB) reviewed and approved the plan to remove insecure protocols and cipher suites. The plan included a rollback script and a tiered deployment approach.

### Step 10 ) Remediation Effort

#### Remediation Round 1: Outdated Wireshark Removal

The server team used a PowerShell script to remove outdated Wireshark. A follow-up scan confirmed successful remediation.

#### Remediation Round 2: Insecure Protocols & Ciphers

The server team used PowerShell scripts to remediate insecure protocols and cipher suites. A follow-up scan verified successful remediation, and the results were saved for reference.

#### Remediation Round 3: Guest Account Group Membership

The server team removed the guest account from the administrator group. A new scan confirmed remediation, and the results were exported for comparison.

#### Remediation Round 4: Windows OS Updates

Windows updates were re-enabled and applied until the system was fully up to date. A final scan verified the changes

### First Cycle Remediation Effort Summary

The remediation process reduced total vulnerabilities by 80%, from 30 to 6. Critical vulnerabilities were resolved by the second scan (100%), and high vulnerabilities dropped by 90%. Mediums were reduced by 76%. In an actual production environment, asset criticality would further guide future remediation efforts.

### On-going Vulnerability Management (Maintenance Mode)

After completing the initial remediation cycle, the vulnerability management program transitions into **Maintenance Mode**. This phase ensures that vulnerabilities continue to be managed proactively, keeping systems secure over time. Regular scans, continuous monitoring, and timely remediation are crucial components of this phase. (See [Finalized Policy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rvueLX_71pOR8ldN9zVW9r_zLzDQxVsnSUtNar8ftdg/edit?usp=drive_link) for scanning and remediation cadence requirements.)

Key activities in Maintenance Mode include:
- **Scheduled Vulnerability Scans**: Perform regular scans (e.g., weekly or monthly) to detect new vulnerabilities as systems evolve.
- **Patch Management**: Continuously apply security patches and updates, ensuring no critical vulnerabilities remain unpatched.
- **Remediation Follow-ups**: Address newly identified vulnerabilities promptly, prioritizing based on risk and impact.
- **Policy Review and Updates**: Periodically review the Vulnerability Management Policy to ensure it aligns with the latest security best practices and organizational needs.
- **Audit and Compliance**: Conduct internal audits to ensure compliance with the vulnerability management policy and external regulations.
- **Ongoing Communication with Stakeholders**: Maintain open communication with teams responsible for remediation, ensuring efficient coordination.

By maintaining an active vulnerability management process, organizations can stay ahead of emerging threats and ensure long-term security resilience.
