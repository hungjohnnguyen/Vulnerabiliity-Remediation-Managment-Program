### Vulnerability Management Policy Draft Creation

This phase focuses on drafting a Vulnerability Management Policy as a starting point for stakeholder engagement. The initial draft outlines scope, responsibilities, and remediation timelines, and may be adjusted based on feedback from relevant departments to ensure practical implementation before final approval by upper management.  
[Draft Policy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tx2xxKo-FgmGyjub9MSgKi6hk2ujimTsSfu4dRnroBc/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.wzer8el0objm)

### Step 2) Mock Meeting: Policy Buy-In (Stakeholders)

This phase simulates a stakeholder meeting designed to secure buy-in from the server team for the proposed Vulnerability Management Policy. The purpose is twofold:

Introduce the draft policy ‚Äî outlining its scope, responsibilities, and remediation timelines for vulnerabilities of varying severity.
Assess operational feasibility ‚Äî ensuring the remediation expectations are realistic and achievable given the team‚Äôs resources, testing procedures, and business continuity needs.
The meeting begins with the Security Lead presenting the policy, emphasizing its role in reducing risk exposure for critical systems and safeguarding sensitive client data. The server team is invited to share practical concerns, especially regarding the short turnaround time for critical vulnerability remediation.
Through discussion, it becomes clear that the original 48-hour remediation window for critical vulnerabilities may be impractical due to testing, change management processes, and the potential impact on production environments. The team collectively agrees to extend the window to one week, with an emergency override clause for high-risk situations requiring immediate patching.

By the end of this phase:

The policy draft is adjusted collaboratively to balance security requirements with operational realities.
Stakeholders feel heard and invested, improving the likelihood of policy adoption.
Next steps include revising the document to reflect changes and preparing it for upper management review.

</div>


### Step 3) Policy Finalization and Senior Leadership Sign-Off

After collecting feedback from the server team, adjustments were made to ensure the policy was realistic and achievable in daily operations. In particular, remediation timelines were revised to balance security urgency with operational feasibility.
Following revisions, the policy was submitted to senior leadership for final review and approval. Once signed off, it became the official guiding document for the organization‚Äôs vulnerability management program.

Key Outcomes:

Incorporated cross-team feedback to improve practical implementation.
Adjusted aggressive remediation timelines to align with resource constraints while maintaining compliance.
Obtained executive approval, giving the policy authority for enforcement and reference in pushback scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>üìù Transcript (click to expand)</summary>

**Context:**  
The goal of this session was to address server team concerns, establish trust in the scanning process, and agree on how to safely begin credentialed vulnerability scans.  

---

**[Hung Nguyen, Security Lead]:** Thanks for joining today. As part of our vulnerability management rollout, we‚Äôd like to begin credentialed scanning on the servers. Before we dive in, we want to make sure your team is comfortable with the process.  

**[Jordan, Server Admin]:** Understood. Our main concern is the performance impact on production systems. We can‚Äôt risk downtime during critical business hours.  

**[Hung Nguyen, Security Lead]:** Absolutely. To address that, we propose starting with just one server. This way, we can monitor CPU, memory, and network impact before rolling it out further.  

**[Priya, Server Admin]:** Which server are you thinking of?  

**[Hung Nguyen, Security Lead]:** We‚Äôd suggest starting with a non-critical server in the staging environment, unless you‚Äôd prefer a low-risk production server.  

**[Jordan, Server Admin]:** Staging makes sense. We can afford a little more flexibility there. But we‚Äôll need to make sure access is properly controlled.  

**[Hung Nguyen, Security Lead]:** Agreed. We‚Äôll be using Just-In-Time (JIT) Active Directory credentials. That means the account only exists for the duration of the scan and is automatically removed afterwards. This way, no standing privileges exist.  

**[Priya, Server Admin]:** That helps. How often are you planning to run these scans?  

**[Hung Nguyen, Security Lead]:** For the pilot, just once. If resource impact is minimal, we‚Äôll discuss moving to a regular schedule‚Äîlikely weekly or biweekly.  

**[Jordan, Server Admin]:** Alright, let‚Äôs proceed with a single scan on staging using JIT credentials. But please share the resource usage report afterward.  

**[Hung Nguyen, Security Lead]:** Absolutely. We‚Äôll document findings, scan duration, and performance logs, then review them with your team.  

**[Jordan, Server Admin]:** Perfect. Let‚Äôs schedule it after business hours tomorrow.  

**[Hung Nguyen, Security Lead]:** Sounds good. Thanks, everyone‚Äîthis is a solid step toward improving visibility without disrupting operations.  

---

### üìå Outcome
- **Decision:** Approved pilot credentialed scan on staging server.  
- **Safeguards:** JIT Active Directory credentials, monitoring CPU/memory/network usage.  
- **Next Steps:** Run pilot scan after business hours; share performance/resource report with server team.

### Step 5) Initial Scan of Server Team Assets

In this phase, a deliberately vulnerable Windows Server instance is provisioned to represent the server team‚Äôs environment. The system is intentionally misconfigured and outdated to introduce common security weaknesses, including missing patches, insecure services, and legacy protocols. Once the environment is prepared, an authenticated vulnerability scan is conducted using temporary credentials to replicate real-world conditions and ensure accurate detection. The scan results are then exported in a sanitized report, which serves as the foundation for prioritizing risks, documenting remediation efforts, and tracking improvements in subsequent phases of the project.

### Step 6) Vulnerability Assessment and Prioritization

We assessed vulnerabilities and established a remediation prioritization strategy based on ease of remediation and impact. The following priorities were set:

1. Third Party Software Removal (Wireshark)
2. Windows OS Secure Configuration (Protocols & Ciphers)
3. Windows OS Secure Configuration (Guest Account Group Membership)
4. Windows OS Updates

**Subject:** Vulnerability Remediation Scripts for Testing and Deployment  

Hi Team,  

Following the results of our initial vulnerability scan and assessment, we have prepared a set of remediation scripts to streamline the mitigation process. These scripts address several high-priority issues and are designed for easy integration into your existing deployment platforms (e.g., SCCM).  

Before pushing these changes into production, please conduct thorough testing in your staging environment to validate functionality and confirm compatibility with your systems.  

### Vulnerabilities and Remediations Addressed
- **Third-Party Software Removal:** Automated removal of Wireshark to reduce unnecessary attack surface.  
- **Windows OS Secure Configuration:**  
  - Disable insecure protocols.  
  - Remove/disable weak cipher suites.  
  - Review and restrict Guest account group membership.  

Your feedback will be critical to ensuring these remediations are both effective and minimally disruptive. Please share any issues or observations after testing so we can refine the scripts prior to the full rollout.  

Thank you for your prompt attention to this effort.  

Best regards,  
**[Hung Nguyen]**  
Security Operations

<details>
  <summary>üìù Transcript (click to expand)</summary>

**Context:**  
The goal of this session was to validate identified issues, discuss remediation approaches, and prepare remediation packages for submission to the Change Control Board (CAB).

---

**[Hung Nguyen, Security Lead]:** Thank you all for joining. Today‚Äôs focus is the results of our initial discovery scan. Overall, the scan flagged outdated software versions, insecure user accounts, and several deprecated protocols still in use.  

**[Server Admin 1]:** Yes, I noticed multiple servers still running older versions of Java and a few legacy applications with embedded dependencies. We‚Äôll need to schedule upgrades or replacements.  

**[Server Admin 2]:** On the accounts side, the scan flagged some inactive service accounts that still have elevated privileges. Disabling those should be a quick win.  

**[Jordan, Security Analyst]:** Correct. We also saw deprecated protocols ‚Äî specifically SMBv1 and TLS 1.0 ‚Äî enabled on some Windows servers. Those configurations need to be updated as part of our hardening efforts.  

**[Hung Nguyen, Security Lead]:** Good observations. The remediation scripts for removing outdated software and disabling insecure protocols are ready. We‚Äôll also include a package to restrict the flagged accounts.  

**[Server Admin 1]:** Understood. We‚Äôll test those remediation packages in staging first, then prepare them for CAB review.  

**[Server Admin 2]:** Agreed. Once CAB approves, we can schedule deployment during the next maintenance window.  

**[Hung Nguyen, Security Lead]:** Perfect. Let‚Äôs finalize the remediation packages and submit them to CAB this week. Thank you, everyone.  

---

### üìå Outcome
- **Identified Issues:** Outdated software, insecure accounts, deprecated protocols.  
- **Next Steps:** Remediation packages prepared and readied for CAB submission.  
- **Owner:** Server Team, with oversight from Security Operations.

## Step 9) Mock CAB Meeting: Implementing Remediations

The Change Control Board (CAB) reviewed the plan to remove insecure protocols and weak cipher suites.  

<details>
  <summary>üìù Transcript (click to expand)</summary>

**Context:**  
The CAB convened to review and approve the remediation plan addressing insecure protocols and weak cipher suites. The proposal included a rollback script and a phased (tiered) deployment approach to minimize operational risk.

---

**[CAB Chair]:** Welcome, everyone. Today‚Äôs agenda is the remediation plan targeting insecure protocols and deprecated cipher suites. Security Ops, can you brief us on the proposal?  

**[Hung Nguyen, Security Lead]:** Certainly. Our scans identified systems still running SMBv1 and TLS 1.0, along with several weak cipher suites. The remediation package disables those settings. We‚Äôve also included a rollback script in case critical services encounter issues.  

**[Server Admin]:** We validated the package in staging. Everything worked as expected, and the rollback process restores original settings within minutes.  

**[Application Owner]:** Any concerns about compatibility with legacy applications?  

**[Server Admin]:** A few legacy apps are flagged for extra testing. None are business-critical, and we have the rollback safeguard if needed.  

**[CAB Chair]:** And the deployment strategy?  

**[Hung Nguyen, Security Lead]:** Tiered rollout‚Äîstart with non-critical servers, monitor stability/performance, then move to critical systems after validation.  

**[CAB Member]:** Are monitoring and reporting in place?  

**[Hung Nguyen, Security Lead]:** Yes. We‚Äôll review logs daily and provide CAB updates after each wave.  

**[CAB Chair]:** With rollback and phased deployment, risk is acceptable. Any objections?  

**[CAB Members]:** None.  

**[CAB Chair]:** Approved. Proceed as outlined and report after each phase.

---

### üìå Outcome
- **Decision:** CAB approved remediation plan.  
- **Scope:** Disable SMBv1, TLS 1.0, and weak cipher suites.  
- **Safeguards:** Rollback script + tiered deployment.  
- **Next Steps:** Begin phased rollout, monitor, and report progress to CAB.

### Step 10 ) Remediation Effort

#### Remediation Round 1: Outdated Wireshark Removal

The server team used a PowerShell script to uninstall the outdated version of Wireshark from the systems. A follow-up vulnerability scan verified that the removal was successful and the issue had been resolved.

---

### On-going Vulnerability Management (Maintenance Mode)

After completing the initial remediation cycle, the vulnerability management program transitions into **Maintenance Mode**. This phase ensures that vulnerabilities continue to be managed proactively, keeping systems secure over time. Regular scans, continuous monitoring, and timely remediation are crucial components of this phase. (See [Finalized Policy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rvueLX_71pOR8ldN9zVW9r_zLzDQxVsnSUtNar8ftdg/edit?usp=drive_link) for scanning and remediation cadence requirements.)

Key activities in Maintenance Mode include:
- **Scheduled Vulnerability Scans**: Perform regular scans (e.g., weekly or monthly) to detect new vulnerabilities as systems evolve.
- **Patch Management**: Continuously apply security patches and updates, ensuring no critical vulnerabilities remain unpatched.
- **Remediation Follow-ups**: Address newly identified vulnerabilities promptly, prioritizing based on risk and impact.
- **Policy Review and Updates**: Periodically review the Vulnerability Management Policy to ensure it aligns with the latest security best practices and organizational needs.
- **Audit and Compliance**: Conduct internal audits to ensure compliance with the vulnerability management policy and external regulations.
- **Ongoing Communication with Stakeholders**: Maintain open communication with teams responsible for remediation, ensuring efficient coordination.

By maintaining an active vulnerability management process, organizations can stay ahead of emerging threats and ensure long-term security resilience.
